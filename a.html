                 <h1>football</h1>
                <artical>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the
                word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly
                called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and
                sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically
                American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby
                union football.[1] These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football
                codes".
                
                There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of
                the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English
                public schools during the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football.[5][6] The expansion and cultural power
                of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly
                controlled empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football,
                for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their
                heritage.[8] In 1888, the Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football
                associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular
                team sports in the world.[9]</artial>

                    <h1>basketball</h1>
                <artical>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular
                court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter)
                through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at
                each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth
                two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the
                player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with
                the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of
                play (overtime) is mandated.
                
                Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of
                which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots â€“ the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk;
                on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may
                collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's
                pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.
                
                The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the
                second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and
                the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implement the coach's
                game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play
                three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.
                
                Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, in the United States,
                basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.[1][2] The National Basketball
                Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries,
                talent, and level of competition[3][4] (drawing most of its talent from U.S. college basketball). Outside North America,
                the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball
                Champions League Americas. The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are the major
                international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world. Each continent hosts regional
                competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup.
                
                The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup and Women's Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national teams from
                continental championships. The main North American league is the WNBA (NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship
                is also popular), whereas the strongest European clubs participate in the EuroLeague Women.
